                and record producer. He is the lead vocalist and only remaining original member of the pop rock band Imagine Dragons. Reynolds also released an EP in 2011, 
                titled Egyptian â€“ EP, as a duo with his wife Aja Volkman under the moniker Egyptian. He is a recipient of the Songwriters Hall of Fame Hal David Starlight Award.
                Reynolds was initially reluctant to become a professional musician, partially because future bandmate Wayne Sermon had once told him: "Don't do music because you want to do music 
                - do music if you want to be bored for the rest of your life".</p>

                 He is the lead guitarist for the pop rock band Imagine Dragons. Wayne Sermon first met Dan Reynolds after hearing him perform at a
                  club in Utah and approaching him afterwards about his musical interests.
                  Reynolds invited him to join his band and move to Las Vegas. Sermon then invited Ben McKee to join
                   the band on bass, and drummer Daniel Platzman, also a friend of Wayne's from Berklee College 
                   of Music, became the last member to join the group at the invitation of McKee. In Las Vegas,
                 the band performed and honed their craft nearly nightly as a lounge act.
                 Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory.
                  In November 2011 they signed with Interscope Records and began working with producer Alex da Kid.</p>

                acoustic bass in fifth grade. In high school, he continued learning bass guitar as a member of a jazz trio, which influenced his decision to attend Berklee 
                College of Music. While at Berklee, McKee played in a guitar performance ensemble with future Imagine Dragons bandmates Wayne Sermon and Daniel Platzman.
